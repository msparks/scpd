This is a repository of scripts that are helpful in downloading SCPD videos.

The scripts DO NOT make SCPD videos available to the general public. They only
make viewing the videos more convenient and accessible for those students
already authorized to view them.

fetch.sh
  A shell script to download videos given a list of URLs.

scpd.user.js
  A userscript to get direct URLs for SCPD videos. Just install it in your
  browser and then view a list of lectures. The WMV links will be replaced with
  direct video links, and a textarea box will appear towards the bottom of the
  page with all the URLs.

scrape_urls.pl
  A perl script to log in to the SCPD website and scrape all video URLs for the
  current quarter.
